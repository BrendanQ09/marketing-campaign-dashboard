Marketing Campaign Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview
The Marketing Campaign Analysis Dashboard is an interactive tool designed to provide insights into customer behaviors, spending patterns, and campaign effectiveness. It utilizes various machine learning techniques to analyze which factors influence customer engagement and campaign response, enabling marketers to make data-driven decisions for future campaigns.

This project leverages Python, data processing, and machine learning techniques to uncover insights that can optimize marketing strategies and maximize customer engagement.

Features
Customer Segmentation:

Segments customers based on spending levels, recency of purchase, and response to previous campaigns.
Provides a breakdown of customer demographics, including age, income, and marital status.
Campaign Effectiveness Analysis:

Measures the success of different campaigns and identifies customer attributes that correlate with campaign responses.
Analyzes campaign response rates across different customer segments (e.g., spending level, age group).
Machine Learning for Campaign Response Prediction:

Implements models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble Voting) to predict customer response to marketing campaigns.
Uses techniques to handle class imbalance, such as SMOTE, to improve predictive accuracy for the minority class (responders).
Evaluates models using metrics suitable for imbalanced data, such as AUC-ROC and F1-score.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. The primary libraries used are:

Pandas, NumPy for data processing
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost for machine learning and handling class imbalance
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marketing-campaign-dashboard.git
cd marketing-campaign-dashboard
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add your data: Place your CSV files containing campaign data in the data/ folder. Ensure your data has columns such as:

ID, Year_Birth, Education, Marital_Status, Income, Kidhome, Teenhome, Dt_Customer, Recency, MntWines, etc.
Running the Analysis
Data Preprocessing:

Run src/data_processing.py to clean the data, handle missing values, and create new features such as Age, Total_Spending, and Total_Accepted_Campaigns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Use Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder to visualize and explore customer demographics, spending patterns, and campaign responses.
Running the Machine Learning Models:

Run src/model_training.py to train and evaluate models for predicting campaign response.
The models included are Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble Voting for improved prediction accuracy on imbalanced data.
Model results, including accuracy, AUC-ROC, and classification reports, will be printed in the console.
Dashboard (Optional):

If applicable, the dashboard/ folder contains files for a dashboard application to visualize results interactively.
Key Analysis and Results
Customer Insights
The customer base is predominantly aged 40-60, with spending largely concentrated on low to medium levels.
A significant portion of the customers has not accepted any previous campaigns, indicating opportunities for targeted engagement.
Model Performance
Random Forest achieved an accuracy of approximately 82.6% with an AUC-ROC of 0.84, showing strong performance in identifying campaign responders.
XGBoost and Ensemble Voting classifiers were also tested, with slightly lower accuracy but similar recall and precision metrics.
Class Imbalance Handling: Techniques like SMOTE and threshold adjustments improved recall for the minority class (responders), balancing the model’s precision and recall effectively.
Key Insights
Higher spending customers are more likely to respond to campaigns, especially those with specific spending habits (e.g., wine or meat products).
Demographic factors like age and income also play a role, with younger, higher-income customers showing greater engagement.
Future Enhancements
Advanced Feature Engineering: Adding more customer behavior features (e.g., response ratio, average spending per channel) could improve model accuracy.
Automated Reporting: Generate and export insights as a PDF or PowerPoint for easy sharing.
Improved Model Tuning: Experiment with deeper hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost and Random Forest to further improve prediction accuracy.
